# software-engineering-coding-interview-prep
The repository would contain various Questions on Algorithms and Data structures solved in python to assist anyone preparing to take an Interview for a Software Engineering role.
I created this repository to upload the various problems on Algorithms and Data structures I solved while preparing to take Technical Interviews in various companies for a Software Engineering Intern role.

I hope this repository can also assist others who are in a similar position and are preparing to take a technical Interview or a coding exam
